Hi, I'm a Seattle based software engineer at Amazon Web Services with interests in machine learning, physics, and computer graphics. 

I graduated in December of 2022 from the University of Florida with a M.S. degree in computer science. Prior to my time at Florida, I studied physics at Auburn University. I was fortunate to contribute to several research projects at Oak Ridge National Laboratory throughout college. 

I'm currently open to data science and software engineering opportunities in the New York City area :)
