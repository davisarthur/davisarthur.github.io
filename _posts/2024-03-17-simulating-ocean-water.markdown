In this blog, I'll be overviewing an efficient method for simulating and rendering realistic ocean waves.
Specifically, I will cover the following topics:
- Simulating physical ocean wave spectrum
- Implementing the fast Fourier transform (FFT)
- Animating a surface height map
- Optics of rendering water (Snell's law and Fresnel equations)
- Bonus: Simulating water caustics

To be continued!
